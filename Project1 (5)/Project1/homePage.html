												Project 1 </br> 
										It is my first time writing in Html.
									I faced a lot of challenges on css trying to
									re-arrange and have each section on it is own position. 
									I did enjoy it  and I realized that more time you spend
									exploring and playing around, better you get at it. 
									I picked a camera image on the background, because I enjoy 
									exploring new places and saving those memories by capturing 
									the moment. 
										I hope that after this class I will be able to design my own
										website,a project I have been thinking for a while. </p>
